Why
===

This is basically an anti-pink theme. It is intended to remove all the pink from the control panel, reduce the cartoonish rounded corners to something a bit more professional, and clean up some general alignment/padding/margin issues. It is not intended to be a huge overhaul, but instead a redux. It is a work in progress, though very usable. It will be kept light and very much in the spirit of the default theme.

Installation
============

1. Create a directory called "nerdery" inside of /themes/cp_themes and place the contents this repo inside of it. You'll then have /themes/cp_themes/nerdery/
2. Place $config['cp_theme'] = 'nerdery'; into your config.php file to ensure all users receive this theme.
