Draggable
==============================

Draggable adds drag and drop sorting to custom channel fields, member fields, statuses, and categories in the [ExpressionEngine](http://www.expressionengine.com) control panel.

## Installation

To install Draggable:

1. Copy the `/draggable/` folder to your `/system/expressionengine/third_party/` folder.
2. Enable Extensions
3. Install the Draggable Accessory and Extension

Once installed, you'll be able to sort entries on the custom channel fields, member fields, statuses, and categories pages by dragging and dropping the table rows. Row order is saved automatically when you drop the row in its new position.
